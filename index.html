        <h1>Sifteo Blickets</h1>

<p>This repository provides instructions, materials, and code for creating Sifteo "blickets." Sifteo provides a free simulator, so following this tutorial does not require purchasing any Sifteo blocks.</p>

<h2>What are blickets?</h2>

<p>Exactly!
There's no such thing as a blicket; it's neologism created by psychologists to avoid people from having preconceived notions about what it is/isn't or what it can/can't do.
Empty (aka blank) terms are an important tool for studying learning and reasoning because they reduce or remove prior knowledge, allowing researchers to interpret their findings as a (more or less) direct result of their manipulation(s).
Alternatively, if researchers were to ask participants to reason about things they already have strong beliefs about or experience with (e.g., adults and politics or children and toys), it's not clear how much affect a 15 minute experiment would have on getting them to change such beliefs.</p>

<p><strong>blicket</strong> (n. <em>plural</em> blickets)</p>

<ol>
<li>(philosophy) An object with certain properties causing it to trigger a "blicket detector" (a device that lights up and plays music), introduced in certain experiments relating to causality and perception (<a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/blicket">wikitonary</a>).</li>
</ol><p>Blickets have been used extensively for studying how people, mainly children, learn and reason about causality.
These studies use a blicket detector (shown below) to identify blickets.
The experimenter places objects (usually wooden blocks of various shapes and colors) on top of the blicket detector.
If the object is a blicket, predetermined by the experimenter, the light panel of the blicket detector flashes and an internal mechanism plays a short tune (You can build your own here! <a href="http://depts.washington.edu/idl/light_detail.htm">Traditional blicket detector instructions</a>).
In reality, the "blicketness" of an object is entirely arbitrary, so their's no way to actually detect it.
The detector is set off by a hidden switch toggled by the experimenter's foot.</p>

<p>Blickets were first used in a seminal developmental study conducted by Gopnik &amp; Sobel (2000).
They looked at how the causal properties of objects (e.g., making a blicket detector flash and play music) shape toddlers conceptual knowledge.
Previously, most developmental research focused on how perceptual features (color, shape, etc.) influence categorization.
This was motivated by many prominent psychologist, including Piaget, theorizing that young children were unable to understand, and therefore, categorize objects based on causal properties.
To test this theory, Gopnik and Sobel pitted perceptual features against causal ones in a simple, yet elegant, category learning paradigm.</p>

<h3>Materials</h3>

<p>To pit various perceptual features, such as color and shape, against causal ones, Gopnik and Sobel constructed seven sets of four objects out of wooden blocks. Below is our attempt to recreate those objects using Adobe Illustrator. These materials are freely available in the <a href="https://github.com/jbmartin/SifteoBlickets/tree/master/assets">asset folder</a> of this git repository.</p>

<h3>Procedure</h3>

<p>An experimenter presented seven sets of the four objects (shown above) to children.
Set 1 was always presented first, followed by sets 2 through 7 at random.
In sets 1 through 4, two objects were randomly assigned to be blickets.
In sets 5 and 6, two perceptually conflicting blickets were chosen.
In set 5, for example, one blicket might be the green rounded rectangle and the other blicket might be a red rounded rectangle.
Each child was placed either in the "induction" or "categorization" condition.
In the categorization condition, the experimenter placed each of the 4 objects on the blicket detector separately and then returned them to their original spots.
The experimenter then lifted up one of the blickets and asked the child which of the other blocks was also a blicket.
In the induction condition, the experimenter described two objects as being blickets and two as not being blickets. She then placed the blicket on the detector and asked the child which of the remaining blocks would also set off the detector.</p>

<h2>Under the hood: Into the darkness known as C++</h2>

<p>Okay, so that was pretty cool, but you probabily want to be able to design your <em>own</em>  blicket experiment.
Sifteo uses a popular programming language called C++.
I'm not going lie, C++ isn't a great language to learn if you're just starting out.
It's very unforgiving of mistakes and requires quite a bit of knowledge to things that are trivial in scripting languages (Python, Javascript, etc.).
It's mainly shines in large scale production software suits like operating systems or video games where speed and memory are critical (e.g., tiny game cubes with limited memory and large cpu demands).
Fortunately, the Sifteo API wraps up most of the scary parts of dealing with C++ directly.
However, it still rears its ugly head from time to time.
We'll do our best to help you figure out how to deal with it or where to turn go when you're stuck.</p>

<p>First lets look at the basic logic of main.cpp.</p>

(*philosophy*) An object with certain properties causing it to trigger a \"blicket detector\" (a device that lights up and plays music), introduced in certain experiments relating to causality and perception ([wikitonary](http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/blicket)).\r\n\r\nBlickets have been used extensively for studying how people, mainly children, learn and reason about causality. \r\nThese studies use a blicket detector (shown below) to identify blickets.\r\nThe experimenter places objects (usually wooden blocks of various shapes and colors) on top of the blicket detector.\r\nIf the object is a blicket, predetermined by the experimenter, the light panel of the blicket detector flashes and an internal mechanism plays a short tune (You can build your own! [Traditional blicket detector instructions](http://depts.washington.edu/idl/light_detail.htm)).\r\nIn reality, the \"blicketness\" of an object is entirely arbitrary, so their's no way to actually detect it.\r\nThe detector is set off by a hidden switch toggled by the experimenter's foot.\r\n\r\n![][blicket_guts]\r\n![][blicket_detector]\r\n\r\n[blicket_guts]: http://depts.washington.edu/idl/images/blicket_internal_bottom.jpg\r\n[blicket_detector]: http://depts.washington.edu/idl/images/Blicket_top.jpg\r\n\r\nBlickets were first used in a seminal developmental study conducted by Gopnik & Sobel (2000).\r\nThey looked at how the causal properties of objects (e.g., making a blicket detector flash and play music) shape toddlers conceptual knowledge.\r\nPreviously, most developmental research focused on how perceptual features (color, shape, etc.) influence categorization.\r\nThis was largely due to many prominent psychologist, including Piaget, theorizing that young children were unable to understand, and therefore, categorize objects based on causal properties.\r\nTo test this theory, Gopnik and Sobel pitted perceptual features against causal ones in a simple, yet elegant, category learning paradigm.\r\n\r\n###Materials\r\n\r\nTo pit various perceptual features, such as color and shape, against causal ones, Gopnik and Sobel constructed seven sets of four objects out of wooden blocks. Below is our attempt to recreate those objects using using Adobe Illustrator. These materials are freely available under the [asset folder](https://github.com/jbmartin/SifteoBlickets/tree/master/assets) of this git repo.\r\n\r\n####Set 1: Four Identical Objects:\r\n![][green_rect]  ![][green_rect]  ![][green_rect] ![][green_rect]\r\n\r\n####Set 2: Same Color Different Shape:\r\n![][green_rect]  ![][green_sq]  ![][green_rounded_rect] ![][green_oval]\r\n\r\n####Set 3: Same Shape Different Color:\r\n![][red_rect]  ![][green_rect]  ![][yellow_rect] ![][blue_rect]\r\n\r\n####Set 4: Different Colors Different Shapes:\r\n![][green_sq]  ![][blue_oval]  ![][red_tri] ![][yellow_rounded_rect]\r\n\r\n####Set 5: Same Shape Conflicts Color:\r\n![][green_rounded_rect]  ![][green_rounded_rect]  ![][red_rounded_rect] ![][red_rounded_rect]\r\n\r\n####Set 6: Same Color Conflicts Shape:\r\n![][green_rounded_rect]  ![][green_rounded_rect]  ![][green_sq] ![][green_sq]\r\n\r\n####Set 7: Conflicts Shape and Color:\r\n![][red_rect]  ![][red_rect]  ![][green_sq] ![][green_sq]\r\n\r\n[green_rect]: https://github.com/jbmartin/SifteoBlickets/blob/master/assets/green_rect.png?raw=true\r\n[red_rect]: https://github.com/jbmartin/SifteoBlickets/blob/master/assets/red_rect.png?raw=true\r\n[yellow_rect]: https://github.com/jbmartin/SifteoBlickets/blob/master/assets/yellow_rect.png?raw=true\r\n[green_oval]: https://github.com/jbmartin/SifteoBlickets/blob/master/assets/green_oval.png?raw=true\r\n[green_sq]: https://github.com/jbmartin/SifteoBlickets/blob/master/assets/green_sq.png?raw=true\r\n[green_rounded_rect]: https://github.com/jbmartin/SifteoBlickets/blob/master/assets/green_rounded_rect.png?raw=true\r\n[blue_oval]: https://github.com/jbmartin/SifteoBlickets/blob/master/assets/blue_oval.png?raw=true\r\n[blue_rect]: https://github.com/jbmartin/SifteoBlickets/blob/master/assets/blue_rect.png?raw=true\r\n[red_tri]: https://github.com/jbmartin/SifteoBlickets/blob/master/assets/red_tri.png?raw=true\r\n[yellow_rounded_rect]: https://github.com/jbmartin/SifteoBlickets/blob/master/assets/yellow_rounded_rect.png?raw=true\r\n[red_rounded_rect]: https://github.com/jbmartin/SifteoBlickets/blob/master/assets/red_rounded_rect.png?raw=true\r\n\r\n###Procedure\r\n![][screen_shot]\r\n\r\n[screen_shot]: https://github.com/jbmartin/SifteoBlickets/blob/master/blog_assets/screen_shot.png?raw=true\r\n\r\n##How do Sifteo blocks help?\r\nBrief description and links\r\n\r\n##Basics\r\n0.
